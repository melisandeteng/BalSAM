# Getting started

Instrcutions for running training baseline models and running inference are in each baseline's corresponding subfolder. 
You can set up the same Python 3.10 environment for all these baselines following 

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

uv venv trees_env -p 3.10

source trees_env/bin/activate

uv pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
